    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What kinds of snakes do you relocate?</strong><br>
    A: Any and all, though there a couple species here in Texas that are protected that will require special handling. More details on those species available!</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How quickly can you respond?</strong><br>
    A: I am generally available 24/7, however there may be times that I cannot respond in a reasonable time. In those cases I will do my best to either talk your through how to best handle your situation or find additional assistance with you.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Do you charge for relocation services?</strong><br>
    A: No! I do this for the benefit of the ecosystem, and the safety of humans and pets! Though, tips and donations are welcome and deeply appreciated.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What should I do if I see a snake near my home?</strong><br>
    A: If the snake is not in a location that is causing immediate danger to others/pets, firstly: Don't Panic. They aren't out to get you. If you intend to have the snake removed and relocated, it is important to keep your eyes on the snake as usually within minutes of being spotted, they will relocate themselves and you may lose their location.</p>
